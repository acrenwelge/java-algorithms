# java-algorithms
Implementations of various algorithms in Java.

Organized as an Eclipse Java project, using **JUnit 5** for unit tests.

### Setup
Include JUnit 5 on the build path


### Algorithms
Solutions are organized into packages within the `algorithms` package:
* math
* search
* sort
* geometry
* games

Each implementation contains:
* problem description / overview
* description of input parameters
* explanation of time complexity (big-O notation)
* advantages / disadvantages - naive / brute force improvements

Each implementation comes with multiple associated unit tests.
